# Implementation-of-A-and-Dijkstra-on-a-Quarry-area
# Introduction
I have implimented this A-Star and Dijkstra Algorithm as a part of the coursework. I wrote the code and implimented in google collab.
Algorithms are used to find path on the 3 different resolutions of the same occupancy grid map provided. Finally, An attempt is made to evaluate the following: 
1. Computation time of the algorithm for the different resolutions
2. Computation time and results of both the algorithms.

# Implimentation
Dowload the IPYNB files and open in the google collab and execute all the cells. You can arrange the parameters accordingly or replace your own images.

# This is how the results looks
After implimentation, one of the end results look as below:
# A-Star Result:
